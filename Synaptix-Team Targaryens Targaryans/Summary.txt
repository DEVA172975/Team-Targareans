1. Description of the Problem , We are solving:

   Businesses—especially small and medium enterprises—generate financial data continuously in the form of revenue records, tax-related documents, and competitor information. However, most existing systems that process this data operate in a static and batch-oriented manner. Once data is uploaded and analyzed, the generated insights remain unchanged until the user manually reprocesses the information. This creates a critical gap between real-world change and AI-driven understanding.

Traditional AI systems worsen this problem. Transformer-based models and conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines treat each interaction as isolated. They do not retain long-term contextual memory, nor do they automatically adapt when underlying documents change. As a result:

Insights become outdated quickly

Businesses rely on stale conclusions

Changes in revenue, tax rules, or competitive conditions go unnoticed

Decision-making is delayed or misinformed

Furthermore, existing accounting and analytics tools focus on recording data, not reasoning over evolving data. They present numbers and charts but fail to explain why a change occurred or what it implies for the business.

The core problem addressed by this project is the absence of an intelligent system that can continuously observe financial data, remember past context, and re-evaluate insights automatically as new information arrives. There is a strong need for an AI system that behaves less like a static calculator and more like a living financial analyst.

3. Approach and Why It Matters:
3.1 Proposed Approach:

The project adopts an agentic, event-driven approach to financial intelligence rather than a traditional query-based AI model.

Step 1: User-Centric Data Ingestion

Users upload revenue data, tax rules, and competitor information through dedicated application pages. These inputs are validated and stored securely, with metadata maintained in a relational database.

Step 2: Live Data Monitoring with Pathway

Instead of processing data once and freezing insights, the system uses Pathway’s live document indexing and streaming engine to continuously monitor data sources. Any modification to a file—whether a revenue update or a tax rule change—is detected immediately.

Step 3: Persistent Contextual Memory

The system maintains awareness of historical data states. This allows the AI to understand not just the current values, but how those values evolved over time.

Step 4: Agentic Reasoning

 An AI agent performs multi-step reasoning:

 It compares new data against previous states

 Identifies meaningful deviations or trends

 Evaluates tax impact, revenue efficiency, and competitive positioning

 This reasoning process is autonomous and does not require explicit user prompts   after every data change.

Step 5: Explainable Insight Generation

 The final output is not limited to numbers or charts. The AI generates natural language explanations describing:

 What changed

 Why it changed

 What the change means for the business

 These insights are presented dynamically in the user interface.

3.2 Why This Approach Matters
1. Solves the Stale Knowledge Problem

   By using live data streaming, the system ensures the AI never reasons on outdated information. This directly addresses one of the most significant limitations of current AI applications.

2. Demonstrates True Agentic Behavior

   The AI does not merely respond to questions—it observes, adapts, and re-evaluates continuously, which is a key characteristic of next-generation intelligent systems.

3. Enhances Decision-Making Quality

   Business owners receive timely, contextual insights rather than static reports, enabling faster and more informed decisions.

4. Prioritizes Explainability and Trust

   Clear explanations build user confidence and make AI outputs actionable rather than opaque.

5. Aligns with the Future of AI Systems

   The approach reflects a shift from static model usage to experience-driven, memory-aware intelligence, making it highly relevant for modern enterprise applications.
